# Supplementary material of the work *An exact dynamic programming approach to segmented isotonic regression*

## Overview

In this repository, we provide the input data used in the paper entitled *An exact dynamic programming approach to segmented isotonic regression* by Víctor Bucarey, Martine Labbé, Juan M. Morales and Salvador Pineda and available via arxiv in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03697). 

## Database

Folder "synthetic" contains the data used in Section 5.1. The data used for each value of I and K are denoted as dataI_K.csv.

Folder "realistic" contains the data used in Section 5.2. The excel file data.xlsx includes the 6 sheets explained below:
- nodes: node voltage limits
- lines: network parameters
- producers: location and capacity of solar generating units
- consumers: distribution and power factor of electricity loads
- capacity factors: solar and load distribution factors throughout time
- response: aggregated power intake of the distribution network for different prices at the main substation
